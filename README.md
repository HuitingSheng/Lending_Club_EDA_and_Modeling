# Lending_Club_EDA_and_Modeling

LendingClub is an American peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

Our goal is to use the data provided in order to predict if the borrower will repay the loan by its maturity date or not. In particular will will focus on customer's who are deemed high risk for default/charge-off.

A Rshiny app is built to show the sensitivity and specificity at different threshold for each model. https://shenghuiting.shinyapps.io/Lending_Club_Default_Loan_Prediction/
